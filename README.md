# 🛡️ Simulation of DoS (Denial of Service) Attack
This project demonstrates a Denial of Service (DoS) attack in a controlled virtual lab environment.
The attack was simulated using Kali Linux (as the attacker) and Windows 10/11 (as the victim) to analyze how excessive malicious traffic impacts system performance.
The experiment was performed for academic and cybersecurity training purposes only, and all machines were isolated from the internet to ensure safety and compliance.

⚠️ **Disclaimer**

- This project is strictly for **educational purposes**.
- Performing DoS attacks on systems you do not own or without explicit permission is illegal and may result in severe legal consequences.
- Always practice in a safe, offline lab environment.
