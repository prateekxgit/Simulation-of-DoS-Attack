# Simulation of DoS (Denial of Service) Attack

# Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **Denial of Service (DoS) attack** in a **controlled virtual lab environment**.
The attack was simulated using **Kali Linux** (as the attacker) and **Windows 10/11** (as the victim) to analyze how excessive malicious traffic impacts system performance.
The experiment was performed for academic and cybersecurity training purposes only, and all machines were isolated from the internet to ensure safety and compliance.

> ⚠ **Disclaimer**:
> This project is strictly for **educational purposes**.
> Performing DoS attacks on systems you do not own or without explicit permission is **illegal** and may result in severe legal consequences.
> Always practice in a safe, offline lab environment.

# Objectives
* To understand the working mechanism of a DoS attack in a safe, controlled environment.
* To explore and use different offensive security tools for network flooding.
* To analyse the network traffic generated during the attack using Wireshark.
* To study the impact of a DoS attack on system performance.
* To develop an awareness of mitigation techniques and defensive strategies.

# Tools & Technologies Used

**Operating Systems**:
* **Kali Linux** – Attacker Machine.
* **Windows 11** – Target Machine.
